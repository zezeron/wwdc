						<p>To register and attend WWDC19, you must agree to all terms and conditions in this WWDC19 Registration and Attendance Policy. If you do not agree, you may not register or attend.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Registration and Tickets</strong>
    <br>Each ticket to attend WWDC19 costs 1599 United States dollars (“USD”) and offers access to five days of sessions, hands-on
    labs, and special events on a first-come, first-served basis and in accordance with these terms.</p>

<p>Due to limited availability, tickets are allocated through a random selection process. In order to be included in the random
    selection process to buy a ticket to attend WWDC19, you must:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Be a member of the Apple Developer Program or the Apple Developer Enterprise Program as of March&nbsp;14, 2019 at 9:00 a.m. PDT;
    </li>
    <li>Submit your registration form with accurate information;</li>
    <li>Verify the payment credentials associated with your Apple ID or submit a payment processing form with your credit/debit
        card information if the WWDC19 ticket or Apple Store is not available in your country; and</li>
    <li>Authorize Apple to automatically charge your credit/debit card 1599 USD, if you are assigned a ticket to WWDC19.</li>
</ul>

<p>By submitting your registration form, and, only if you are selected for a ticket, you understand and agree that the default
    credit/debit card associated with your Apple ID will be charged 1599 USD for the price of the ticket. If you would like
    to change the credit/debit card that will be used to purchase your ticket, you can do so by visiting your account settings
    on the Apple Store.</p>

<p>If you are randomly selected for a WWDC19 ticket, you authorize Apple to complete a charge of 1599 USD on your default credit/debit
    card by March 21, 2019 at 5:00 p.m. PDT, and you understand and agree that your default credit/debit card will automatically
    be charged and the ticket will be assigned to your Apple developer account. As an exception to the foregoing, with your
    permission, Apple reserves the right to charge your credit/debit card after this date, e.g., to resolve a billing issue.
    If WWDC19 tickets are not available for purchase in your country using the default credit/debit card associated with
    your Apple ID, you may be asked upon registering to enter billing information for a credit/debit card that can be charged
    in USD.</p>

<p>Your credit/debit card will not be charged at the time of registration and will only be charged if you are assigned a ticket.
    If you are not assigned a ticket, there will be no charge. If you need to withdraw your registration, you may do so on
    the WWDC19 registration page. You may withdraw your registration until March 20, 2019 at 5:00 p.m. PDT.
</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to ensure that you have sufficient funds in your account for the ticket purchase. You may want
    to notify your bank or credit card company in advance that you may be charged for a WWDC19 ticket by Apple for the amount
    of 1599 USD. This will help ensure your payment is processed. You are responsible for choosing to submit a registration
    form and Apple will not be liable for any errors in submission, payment, or ticket processing. Apple reserves the right
    to reallocate your ticket if there is an error or Apple is otherwise unable to complete your payment transaction.</p>

<p>You may only submit one registration per person for WWDC and only one ticket will be awarded per individual. You understand and agree that tickets are non-refundable. Tickets may not be sold, resold,
    bartered, auctioned, or transferred in any way. Also as an exception to the foregoing, requests to transfer tickets among
    eligible members of the same development team may be submitted to Apple for consideration at
    <a href="mailto:wwdc@apple.com">wwdc@apple.com</a>. Apple reserves the right to reject any transfer requests. Any other transfers will render the ticket
    null and void without any responsibility to Apple. Tickets are also subject to the Apple Store Sales &amp; Refund Terms and
    Conditions. Apple reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel tickets, registrations, or orders and to limit
    order quantity (for example, if a buyer does not adhere to the Apple Store Sales &amp; Refund Terms and Conditions or this
    WWDC19 Registration and Attendance Policy).</p>

<p>You understand and agree that your Apple Developer Program account must be current, valid, and in good standing through
    the end of WWDC19 to attend the conference.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Locations</strong>
    <br>WWDC19 will take place at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, California, USA. The WWDC19 Bash will take place
    at Discovery Meadow. You are responsible for transportation to the conference and related events. Apple reserves the
    right to change venues due to weather, capacity, or any other issues without notice and without liability.</p>
    
    <p>Apple will make reasonable efforts to provide a visa letter for attendees who are required to have one to attend WWDC19. If you need to appeal a visa denial, please direct your appeal to the appropriate embassy. Apple will not be liable or responsible for obtaining any visas for attendees or for any related appeals. Attendance at WWDC19 is prohibited for residents of embargoed countries, individuals ordinarily residing in embargoed countries, or individuals otherwise prohibited by applicable export controls and sanctions programs.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Badges</strong>
    <br>Before being admitted to WWDC19 and obtaining a WWDC19 badge, all attendees will be required to present a valid passport
    or other government-issued identification (copies will not be accepted) that matches the name on the ticket in order
    to receive admission to WWDC19. If you are between the ages of 13 and 17, you may present a valid passport or educationally-issued
    photo identification. WWDC19 badges may contain NFC or other RFID technologies to help us check in and serve attendees.</p>

<p>You must wear your WWDC19 badge at all times, unless otherwise permitted by Apple, to receive admittance to WWDC19 and during the sessions, labs, and WWDC19 Bash.
    If requested by security, attendees may be required to provide additional identification.</p>

<p>WWDC19 badges (or any part thereof) are not replaceable or transferable. You agree not to share, transfer, give, or otherwise provide your badge
    to anyone.
</p>

<p>Apple is not responsible for any badges or property that is lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed at WWDC19. Your badge may
    be invalidated by Apple if any portion has been removed or defaced, or Apple suspects that you have altered your
    badge.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Sessions and Labs</strong>
    <br>Attendance at sessions and labs for WWDC19 is on a first-come, first-served basis and space is limited to attendees only.
    All presentations at WWDC19 will be in English.</p>

<p>Apple may add, substitute, or cancel sessions and/or vary advertised programs or event times without prior notice. Apple
    does not guarantee that you will be informed of such changes before the date of WWDC19. Apple will not be liable for
    loss of enjoyment or wasted expenditures. You voluntarily assume all risk and danger incidental to attending WWDC19,
    whether occurring prior to, during or subsequent to WWDC19, and Apple will not be liable for any resulting harm, including
    death, personal injury, loss, damage or any other liability. Apple will have no liability to attendees and hereby disclaims
    any and all warranties of any kind, express or implied for WWDC19. Admission to WWDC19 may also be subject to additional
    conditions of admission to the McEnery Convention Center and other venues used for conference events.</p>
						<p>
    <strong>Code of Conduct</strong>
    <br>Apple is committed to diversity and to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone. All attendees
    have the right to a safe and welcoming environment regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
    orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, or any other attributes. In addition
    to treating others respectfully, please do not bring items with disrespectful, malicious, or derogatory writing,
    images, or audio to the conference.</p>

<p>Apple reserves the right to refuse admittance to, or remove any person from WWDC19 (including from any WWDC19 events) at
    any time in its sole discretion with no refund, including but not limited to attendees behaving in an inappropriate,
    disorderly, disrespectful, or dangerous manner or failing to comply with this WWDC19 Registration and Attendance Policy. All
    attendees must follow safety signage, instructions, and rules. If you have an experience that violates this code of conduct,
    visit Attendee Services and ask for a manager.</p>

<p>

    <br>Photographs, audio and/or video taken at WWDC19 by Apple, or others on behalf of Apple, may include your voice, image
    or likeness. You agree that Apple may use such photographs, audio and/or video, including those that may contain your
    voice, image or likeness, for any purpose on a worldwide basis in perpetuity, without any compensation to you, and you
    release Apple from all liability related thereto.</p>
