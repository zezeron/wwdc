            before submitting.</li>
        <li>If you apply as a student, you must provide a PDF, PNG, or JPG of your current class schedule or other current proof

    <br>
    You may only submit one application per person for the WWDC19 Scholarship and only one scholarship will be awarded per individual. Scholarship submissions are only accepted through the form available at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/scholarships/apply/" target="_blank">developer.apple.com/wwdc19/scholarships/apply</a>. Submissions will not be accepted through any other channel or after submissions are closed.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Information Submitted to Apple Not Deemed Confidential</strong>
    <br>Apple works with many software developers and some of their products may be similar to or compete with the Swift playground
    you submit. Apple may also be developing its own similar or competing apps, playgrounds, products or services or may
    decide to do so in the future. To avoid potential misunderstandings, Apple cannot agree, and expressly disclaims, any
    confidentiality obligations or use restrictions, express or implied, with respect to your submission or any information
    that you provide in connection with your scholarship application (“Applicant Disclosures”). You agree that all such Applicant
    Disclosures will be non-confidential. Submitting a Swift playground submission as part of this scholarship application
    does not grant Apple any ownership interest in your submission, and you retain your rights in your submission.

</p>

<p>
    <strong>Scholarship Judging</strong>
    <br> Submissions will be judged on:
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>technical accomplishment in the submitted Swift playground;</li>
        <li>creativity of ideas in the submitted Swift playground; and</li>
        <li>content of written responses to the questions in the application form.</li>
    </ul>
<br>All decisions made by the judges are final and scoring is confidential. In the event of a tie, preference will be given to the applicant who has not previously received a scholarship. If a recipient is unable
    to attend, Apple may contact the applicant with the next highest score, at Apple’s sole discretion.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Reasons for Disqualification</strong>
    <br> Your submission may not be considered for a WWDC19 Scholarship if it does not follow all eligibility and submission
    requirements or if it meets any of the conditions listed below:
    <ul>
        <li>Your Swift playground does not function during the judging process.</li>
        <li>The Swift playground you provide was not built by you, or was built by more than one person. Group work will not
            be considered. Plagiarized work will not be considered and may disqualify you from future scholarship opportunities.</li>
        <li>Your Swift playground requires sign in.</li>
        <li>You track and/or insert analytics code in your Swift playground meant to identify or track usage or judges.</li>
    </ul>
<br>
In addition, Apple reserves the right to disqualify your current and/or future submission, or withhold or revoke your scholarship
    and/or lodging at any time if:
    <br><Br>
    <ul>
        <li>You submit more than one scholarship application form. Each person is only allowed one submission;</li>
        <li>Any part of your submission is untrue, plagiarized, or fabricated;</li>
        <li>You engage in or previously engaged in harassment or other harmful behavior directed at Apple, Apple employees, other
            scholarship applicants, or WWDC attendees;</li>
        <li>You are awarded a scholarship and do not claim your ticket and lodging by the deadline, or accept it but do not attend
            WWDC daily, unless otherwise agreed by Apple;</li>
        <li>You accept travel assistance and/or lodging but do not check in for the travel and/or lodging arrangements made by
            Apple and do not inform an Apple representative in advance;</li>
            <li>You stay at the provided lodging for a different date range than that arranged by Apple without written permission from Apple;</li>
        <li>You, directly or indirectly, commit any act intended to interfere with the WWDC Scholarship program, including but not limited to falsely discrediting other scholarship applicants to gain a more favorable chance of receiving a scholarship or contacting Apple employees to request more favorable treatment of your submission; or</li>
        <li>You (or your submission) fail to comply with these terms and conditions.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Scholarships</strong>
    <br>If you are a scholarship recipient, you must let us know by April 21, 2019 if you will accept your scholarship. Scholarships
    that are not accepted by this date will be offered to other applicants and forfeited. Each developer selected for a WWDC19
    Scholarship who has agreed to attend WWDC19 will receive a ticket free of charge that entitles the developer to attend
    WWDC19, held between June 3 and June 7, 2019 in San Jose, California, USA, and will receive lodging arranged by Apple
    free of charge, subject to these terms. In addition, one year of individual membership in the Apple Developer Program
    will be assigned free of charge to eligible accounts of recipients age 18 years or older. This membership will start on June 1, 2019 for eligible accounts that do not already have an individual
    membership in the Apple Developer Program. For eligible accounts that already have an individual membership in the Apple Developer
    Program, the membership will be renewed for one year once the current membership expires. Up to three hundred and fifty
    (350) scholarships will be awarded at Apple’s sole discretion. Only one ticket will be awarded per scholarship recipient.
    Tickets are non-transferable and may not be sold, resold, bartered, auctioned or exchanged for other goods, services
    or benefits. All scholarship recipients must agree to the WWDC19 Registration and Attendance Policy to attend WWDC19.
    In addition, scholarship recipients between the ages of 13 and 17 must have their parent or guardian complete and sign
    the WWDC19 Permission Statement to receive the WWDC19 Scholarship. There will be no substitution of awards and no cash
    awarded in lieu of the WWDC19 ticket or Apple Developer Program membership. All applicable taxes are the sole responsibility
    of the scholarship recipient.
</p>
<p>Apple will provide a light breakfast and lunch, as well as beverages and snacks, at WWDC19 during the conference. Dinner will not be provided. Food that you purchase
    outside of the conference is at your own cost and Apple will not provide reimbursement. If you have a restricted diet
    for breakfast or lunch at WWDC19, let us know by contacting
    <a href="mailto:wwdc@apple.com">wwdc@apple.com</a>, and we will try to accommodate your requests.</p>
<p>Lodging will be provided by a third-party company for all scholarship recipients starting Saturday, June 1, 2019 until Saturday,
    June 8, 2019. You will be assigned to a shared room with another scholarship recipient. If you have a medical need for
    your own room, please contact
    <a href="mailto:wwdc@apple.com">wwdc@apple.com</a>. Conference staff will be available at the lodging venue each day from June 1, 2019 until June 8,
    2019.
</p>
<p>You agree to follow all policies set forth by the third-party and by the lodging venue, and agree that Apple is not responsible
    for these policies in any way.</p>
<p>In addition, Apple will not be responsible for any charges or additional assistance related to lodging, including but not
    limited to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>charges or reimbursement for additional nights of lodging or assistance in finding additional lodging.</li>
    <li>refund for nights of provided lodging not used by you.</li>
    <li>reimbursement for any incidental charges or charges for damage to your room or to the lodging venue caused by you.</li>
    <li>charges incurred due to negligence, disorderly conduct, unlawful activities, or noise caused by you.</li>
    <li>charges or reimbursement for alternate lodging or assistance in finding alternate lodging if you do not wish to use provided
        lodging.
    </li>
    <li>charges or reimbursement for alternate lodging or assistance in finding alternate lodging if you are asked to leave the
        lodging venue due to violating policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lodging and travel expenses for parents or guardians are not provided by Apple. Parents or guardians who wish to accompany
    a scholarship recipient are responsible for their own lodging and travel expenses, and will not receive a ticket to WWDC19
    as part of the WWDC19 Scholarship program. Scholarship recipients under 18 years of age whose parent or guardian does
    not wish to accompany them to WWDC19 must have permission to attend WWDC19 without the presence of a parent or guardian.</p>
<p>Apple is not responsible for any expenses other than those specified in this policy. Need-based travel assistance for air transportation may be
    requested in the submission process and may be provided by Apple at Apple’s sole discretion for up to one hundred and
    twenty five (125) scholarship recipients. Transportation between the airport, the lodging venue, the McEnery Convention
    Center, or any other locations related to WWDC19 will not be provided by Apple. Travel expenses are not reimbursable
    by Apple and are the sole responsibility of the recipient. Attendance at certain WWDC19 events may be limited for attendees
    under 21 years of age.</p>

<p>
    <strong>General Terms</strong>
    <br>All federal, state, and local laws and regulations apply. By applying for a WWDC19 Scholarship, you agree to hold Apple
    and its directors, officers, employees and assigns, harmless against any and all claims and liability arising out of
    your application and/or acceptance of the WWDC19 Scholarship. You assume all liability for any injury or damage caused,
    or claimed to be caused, by participation in this program or use/redemption of the WWDC19 Scholarship. You agree to
    be bound by these terms and conditions and the decisions of the judges, which are final in all respects. You agree that
    Apple shall not be responsible for any typographical or other errors in the administration of the WWDC19 Scholarship
    program.</p>
<p>Photographs, audio and/or video taken as part of the WWDC19 Scholarship program or at WWDC19 by Apple, or others on behalf
    of Apple, may include your voice, image or likeness. By accepting the WWDC19 Scholarship and attending WWDC19, you agree
    that Apple may use such photographs, audio and/or video, including those that may contain your voice, image or likeness,
    for any purpose on a worldwide basis in perpetuity, without any compensation to you, and you release Apple from all liability
    related thereto.</p>
